# Comparison-Report

There are thousands of spoken languages in the world, each one takes a little bit from another but
in whole, they’re different in their own unique ways. This can be said the same for the thousands
of programming languages developed throughout the years. Each language has its own specific
design that enables it to stand out from its competitors but it’s not easy implementing whole new
designs so each language piggybacks off a few other languages as reference. Two very popular
languages today are Python designed by Guido von Russom and C++ designed by Bjarne
Stroustrup. Both of these languages are high-level languages that allow you to focus on the
functionality of applications.
